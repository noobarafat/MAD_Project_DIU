# UniEvent

This is a mobile app built using Flutter that helps university students explore and keep track of campus events. Users can view event details like title, date, time, and category, and also save their favorite events. The app has a profile section where students can update their name, email, and interests, and even change their profile picture from the gallery. Notifications help users stay updated about new or upcoming events. It’s designed to be simple, clean, and easy to use—making student life more active and organized.
